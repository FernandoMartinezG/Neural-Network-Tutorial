# Neural-Network-Tutorial
With the code found in this repository you can learn how to use PyTorch to create and train a neural network to perform tasks such as:

- Linear regression.
- Image recognition.
- Generate new images such as handwritten numbers or faces.

In order for each program to work, you need to decompress the .zip file that comes with the program in the same folder. These .zip files contain the databases needed for the training of each neural network.
